# Aim of the project: 
This project aims towards the design and the development of the robotic legs, and testing the same against the environmental constraints(different terrains), the Torque bearing capacity, the load as well as the shock bearing capabilities of the legs of a Quadruped Robot. So basically designing, manufacturing, testing, and controlling of leg for a quadruped is to be done in this Project. Further we will utilize CAD modeling software such as SOLIDWORKS, ONSHAPE, or FUSION360, depending on their preference, to assemble the quadruped meticulously.
# What is a Quadruped Robot?
A quadruped robot is a type of robot that walks on four legs, mimicking the movement and structure of four-legged animals. These robots are designed to navigate various terrains and maintain stability, making them useful for tasks that require mobility over uneven or complex surfaces. Quadruped robots are commonly used in research, exploration, rescue missions, and other applications where traditional wheeled robots may struggle to operate effectively. The development of quadruped robots involves advanced studies in areas such as robotics, biomechanics, control systems, and artificial intelligence. They often feature sophisticated sensors and algorithms to enable precise movement and adaptability to changing environments.
