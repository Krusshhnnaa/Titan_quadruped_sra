# What is a Quadruped Robot
A quadruped robot is a type of robot that walks on four legs, mimicking the movement and structure of four-legged animals. These robots are designed to navigate various terrains and maintain stability, making them useful for tasks that require mobility over uneven or complex surfaces. Quadruped robots are commonly used in research, exploration, rescue missions, and other applications where traditional wheeled robots may struggle to operate effectively. The development of quadruped robots involves advanced studies in areas such as robotics, biomechanics, control systems, and artificial intelligence. They often feature sophisticated sensors and algorithms to enable precise movement and adaptability to changing environments.

# My leg design Iteration:

In my initial design for power transmission, I planned to use a pulley belt mechanism. However, the system's efficiency did not meet expectations, leading to the decision to discard this iteration.
